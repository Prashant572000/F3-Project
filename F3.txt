TO FIND THE DUPLICATE ROWS QUERY IS:: 
SELECT Order_ID,PORTAL_SKU,Count(*) FROM `orders` GROUP BY Order_ID,PORTAL_SKU HAVING COUNT(*) >1
**901 DUPLICATE ROWS WITH order_id and prtal sku**


TO FIND THE DUPLICATE ROWS QUERY IS:: 
SELECT PORTAL,ORDER_DATE,Order_ID,PORTAL_SKU,PINCODE,STATE,ZONE,BILL_FROM_STATE,QTY,AMOUNT,STATUS,Count(*) FROM `orders` GROUP BY PORTAL,ORDER_DATE,Order_ID,PORTAL_SKU,PINCODE,STATE,ZONE,BILL_FROM_STATE,QTY,AMOUNT,STATUS HAVING COUNT(*) >1
